# AI Skill Showcase

Welcome! 👋

This repository is designed as a lightweight take-home assessment to help us get to know your skills with AI/ML, Python, and Git workflows.  
It should take **1–2 hours** and is meant to be fun and flexible.

---

## 📌 Purpose
- Demonstrate basic familiarity with **Python + Jupyter/Colab**.
- Showcase ability to **train or apply a simple model**.
- Practice working with **Git branches, commits, and merge requests**.
- Give you room to **add your own creativity**.

---

## 🛠️ Candidate Task

1. **Fork or clone** this repository.
2. **Create a new branch** named `feature/<your-name>`.
3. Add a Jupyter Notebook named `<your_name>_showcase.ipynb` that includes:
   - A short markdown intro about yourself.
   - **Step 1:** Generate or load **two images** (from data, synthetic, or AI model).
   - **Step 2:** Apply a transformation or train a simple model that produces different results.
   - **Step 3:** Display both original and transformed/predicted outcomes side-by-side.
   - **Step 4:** Document your approach with markdown cells.
4. **Commit and push** your branch.
5. **Open a Merge Request (PR)** into `main` and request review.

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria
- Notebook runs end-to-end without errors.
- Code is clear, commented, and reproducible.
- Uses markdown to explain steps.
- Shows **two distinct images/outcomes**.
- Follows Git workflow (branch, commit, MR).
- You can use AI to generate code, but we expect you to understand what you're writing
- Shows your commitment and your technical skills (it is a team project after all)

## 🚀 Example
We’ve provided [`example.ipynb`](./example.ipynb) as a Google Colab-friendly demo.  
It trains a simple classifier and shows two separate predictions to illustrate the workflow.
